## Description
LAVA FAUCET is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Magma blockchain that allows users to claim LAVA tokens periodically. It serves as a faucet, distributing a predetermined amount of LAVA tokens to users who interact with it, thereby providing them with a small amount of cryptocurrency for testing or development purposes.

## Features
- **Claim LAVA Tokens**: Users can claim LAVA tokens at regular intervals by completing a captcha verification process.
- **Cool Animation**: A Matrix rain animation is displayed upon successful withdrawal of funds.
- **Network Compatibility Check**: The application checks if the user is connected to the correct blockchain network before allowing withdrawals.

## Dependencies
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **ethers.js**: A library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **@hcaptcha/react-hcaptcha**: A React component for integrating hCaptcha verification.
- **Web3.js**: A library for interacting with Ethereum-compatible blockchains.
- **FontAwesome**: Provides scalable vector icons that can be customized with CSS.
- **CSS Modules**: Enables modular and scoped CSS by default in React applications.
